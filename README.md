# Backendito
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the project dependencies with one of the following commands:

> - `npm install`
> - `pnpm install`

> [!WARNING]
> Use ***only one*** package manager while developing the application, either npm or pnpm, but not both. Mixing two or more package managers may cause inconsistencies due to unsynchronized lock files, among other issues.\
> The README examples use the pnpm package manager, but you can use your preferred one.

## Available commands

### `pnpm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### `pnpm run lint`

Run esLint to show the syntax errors and good practices.

### `pnpm run lint:fix`

The same as `pnpm run lint` but fixes easy problems.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
